excerpt: "What are the next steps?"

---

In the articles [Simplifying the content authoring experience], [Improved handling of rich media] and [Composite pages, listings and content proxies], we have laid out an approach to radically simplify the content authoring experience in Plone.

**We have in one fell swoop eliminated the need for:**

*   Collections as a separate type,
*   Images as a separate type,
*   Composite page types,
*   Proxy (represent one object in two locations) type,
*   Default pages,
*   The need for a separate "Contents" tab,
*   Folder as a separate type.

**We have made it substantially easier to handle:**

*   Rich (“opaque”) media like video, audio and Flash,
*   Content reuse, i.e. generating new content by reusing other content (example: book with 3 different audiences),
*   Application-specific functionality like forms/polls/maps inside a page.

**We have made it possible to:**

*   Share “snippets of Plone” (widgets) to other systems — blogs, iGoogle, Facebook — you name it.

…all while making the UI massively simpler and easier to work with.

And if that wasn’t enough, the infrastructure improvements can be done gradually over a number of small releases in the 3.x series, and then culminate in a Plone 4.0 or 5.0 where we make the entire picture come together in a coherent new user experience. And we mostly don’t need to invent new infrastructure, instead we can build on work done in the Plone 3.x releases.

## Next Steps

Where do we go from here? I want you all to help with fleshing out the plan, as well as contributing code and testing resources to make this happen. The next steps will be:

*   Identify which individual components are needed,
*   Figure out which of them can be built in parallel, and which ones can potentially be included in the 3.x releases,
*   Identify champions for the different areas,
*   Schedule sprints for big-picture integration sessions.

We hope to have the first of these sprints at the [Plone Conference 2008] — and I hope we’ll see you there! Everyone is welcome this time around, and we’re trying to set up a range of sprint tasks, so that developers of all skill levels can participate in different ways.

I hope you will join us in taking Plone to the next level!

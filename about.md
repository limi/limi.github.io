Alex Limi's background is psychology <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> computer science, and he co-founded the open source content management system [Plone] back in 1999.

It is now one of the top 2% open source software projects in the world, with about 800 core developers <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> over 500 add-on developers and [more than 300 companies in 50 countries] providing services, support <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> integration for the system.

In 2003, he co-founded the company Plone Solutions — later known as Jarn. He was instrumental in creating the [Plone Foundation], a non-profit that protects and promotes Plone, defends its trademarks <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> intellectual property — and negotiated funding for the organization with one of the largest tech industry companies in the world.

In 2006, he moved from Norway to San Francisco and worked with [Google] as an interaction designer until 2009, when he started working with the [Firefox] team at [Mozilla] as the Firefox UX Lead. He then transitioned to Product Design Strategy at Mozilla.

In 2013, he joined [Highfive] as a founding team member <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> VP Product Design.

**Other places you might have encountered his work:**

*   He was the keynote speaker at the [Python Conference in 2006].
*   The [Wikipedia] CSS is mostly his work, that’s why Wikipedia looks like the default Plone design — not the other way around.
*   He holds several software patents, even though [software patents are bulls&mdash;t].
*   He has the dubious honor of coining the term “[Embarrassment-Driven Development].”
